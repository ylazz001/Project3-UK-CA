# ML and Wine Quality Prediction

The purpose of this project is to accurately predict whine quality using several ML algorithms (SVM, RF, DT), and compare the results

## Description

This project represents an intersection of traditional winemaking and modern machine-learning technology. It aims to replace the subjective judgments typically associated with wine quality assessment, traditionally performed by expert tasters, with a more objective, data-driven approach. The heart of this study involves analyzing the physicochemical attributes of the renowned Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wines, using data sourced from Cortez et al. (2009). I focus on three advanced machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Trees (DT). These were selected for their proven effectiveness in managing complex data and suitability for diverse tasks like regression and classification.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Before installing and running this project, please ensure you meet the following requirements:

Operating System:

Windows: Windows 10 or later is recommended for optimal compatibility.
macOS: A recent version (macOS Catalina or later) is advisable.
